This set of codes can be used to calculate the uncertainty in dot tracking based BOS measurements. 
It implements the method outlined in:

Rajendran, L. K., Bane, S. P. M. & Vlachos, P. P. Uncertainty amplification due to density/refractive index gradients in background-oriented schlieren experiments. Exp Fluids 61, 139 (2020).

These codes have now been integrated into the main dot tracking package at: https://github.itap.purdue.edu/PavlosVlachosGroup/dot-tracking-package
